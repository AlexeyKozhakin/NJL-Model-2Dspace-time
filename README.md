# NJL-Model-2Dspace-time

This repository contains the implementation of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model in (2+1) space-time dimensions with compactification. The focus is on the search for inhomogeneous phases and their connection to the (1+1) dimensional case.

## Introduction
The NJL model is a theoretical model used in quantum field theory to describe interactions between fermions. This project extends the NJL model to (2+1) dimensions with compactification, aiming to explore the inhomogeneous phases and their relation to the (1+1) dimensional scenario.
